# GitHub Project

**Description:**
- This project was my first project I have uploaded to gitHub! It is a classic "Hello World" program that I titled *Hello World* you would see this program when introducing someone to the syntax of any new coding language.
- In order to make the program work you hard code a string: "Hello world" and call a print method to write it as output to the user. Any editing of the string causes a new output equal to whatever the user writes.
